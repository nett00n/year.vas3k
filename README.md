# My Year Planner (opinionated)

This is a one-pager that helps me plan my year ahead. It's a very opinionated planner that I've been using for years for my own strange needs, but maybe someone else will find it useful too.

The idea is simple: it's a digital imitation of a wall calendar. You can color days in different colors and textures, and write any text on it. That's basically it. Use it however you want and don't forget to save your data.

It all works locally in your browser, saves all your data only locally, and has no server or cloud. 100% private.
